Digital Ocean, 'cloud hosting' provider

_Sat 02 October 2021 18:12 PM GMT_, I signed up for a Digital Ocean '_cloud hosting_' a/c. online...which gives me **$100.00** of FREE cloud hosting services to go and experiement with using. 

-(Not sure if I will use it.../or, if I will be able to find enough time...; most certainly, this would not be the first 'cloud hosting' package I went and signed up for/but, didn't even bother with using...as there's just too many other things to do...go and study learning to use this, that, and, the other programming language/-etc.; but, I'm hoping that I will, at least, 'try' out their online service...just so that I can say...yes, I've already been there/done that, before.)-
