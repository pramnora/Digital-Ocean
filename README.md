# Digital-Ocean
Digital Ocean, 'cloud hosting' provider

_Sat 02 October 2021 18:12 PM GMT_, I signed up for a Digital Ocean '_cloud hosting_' a/c. online...which gives me **$100.00** of FREE cloud hosting services to go and experiment with using. 

-(Not sure if I will use it.../or, if I will be able to find enough time...; most certainly, this would not be the first 'cloud hosting' package I went and signed up for/but, didn't even bother with using...as there's just too many other things to do...go and study learning to use this, that, and, the other programming language/-etc.; but, I'm hoping that I will, at least, 'try' out their online service...just so that I can say...yes, I've already been there/done that, before.)-

Sat 02 October 2021 19:27 PM GMT, signed in to my online Digital Ocean a/c. Decided to try running a 'quick' test web server. All went fine...had it up and running in mere minutes. I choose 'share hosting', UBUNTU 20.04 LTS/1GB. I SSH-ed into it using the Digital Ocean server; and, did some setting up....
- update/upgrade packages; 
- added new user: guest
- switch hostname to become: digital-ocean-server
- etc. 

-(**NOTE**: Still got some more configuration to do...set time zones/-etc.) Well, at least, I can say...I did go and try out using their online service...; and, didn't just lay back...; and, completely ignore it. 'Horray, I got something done! ;-)'

-----

**NOTE**: Unfortunately, when I signed up with Linode...I missed out on the FREE $100.00 trial package; and, so, have to pay for absolutely everything I use there. Thus, I'm now thinking of closing down my Linode a/c. which I have to keep on 'paying' to use...; and, just used this FREE Digital Ocean 'cloud hosting' service offering, instead.
