# Digital-Ocean
Digital Ocean, 'cloud hosting' provider

-----

_Sat 02 October 2021 18:12 PM GMT_, I signed up for a Digital Ocean '_cloud hosting_' a/c. online...which gives me **$100.00** of FREE cloud hosting services to go and experiment with using. 

-(Not sure if I will use it.../or, if I will be able to find enough time...; most certainly, this would not be the first 'cloud hosting' package I went and signed up for/but, didn't even bother with using...as there's just too many other things to do...go and study learning to use this, that, and, the other programming language/-etc.; but, I'm hoping that I will, at least, 'try' out their online service...just so that I can say...yes, I've already been there/done that, before.)-

_Sat 02 October 2021 19:27 PM GMT_, signed in to my online Digital Ocean a/c. Decided to try running a 'quick' test web server. All went fine...had it up and running in just mere minutes. As usual, I choose 'shared hosting' package -as opposed to, 'dedicated'- because it is the 'cheapest'/UBUNTU 20.04 LTS/1GB. I SSH-ed into it using the Digital Ocean web based console; and, did some setting up....

- update/upgrade packages; 
- added new user: guest
- switch hostname to become: digital-ocean-server
- etc. 

-(**NOTE**: Still got some more configuration to do...set time zones/-etc.) Well, at least, I can say...I did go and try out using their online service...; and, didn't just lay back...; and, completely ignore it, altogether. 'Horray, I actually went and got something done! ;-)'

-(**NOTE**: Unfortunately, when I signed up with Linode 'cloud provider'...I missed out on their FREE $100.00 trial package; -(it pays to read, very carefully/or, at least, do some research, first...before jumping in to go buy things online; as, quite often, you will see a 'special offer' going on somewhere)-; and, so, have to keep on paying for absolutely everything I use over there; thus, I'm now thinking of closing down my Linode a/c.; and, just use this FREE Digital Ocean 'cloud hosting' service offering, instead.)- 

-----

_Sat 02 October 2021 20:29 PM GMT_, I needed to confirm if I could SSH remotely into my instance server; -(I used MS-DOS SSH to acheive doing that)- ; and, yes, it worked. Finally, I decided rather than  leave my instance server -which Digital Ocean calls: 'droplet'- up there, and, constantly, running...thus, running up endless charges, as well; to just 'destroy' the instance, instead; which is exactly what I did. This means, the next time I try and create an instance server...I will be given a 'new' IP Address.../and, also, have to re-configure it again starting from total scatch.

-(**NOTE**: It is possible to create scripts which will do all of the pre-configuring for you, automatically; however, I really haven't created any such maintenance scripts, yet...?!)-
